# Here is an example creating a numeric vector named cost
cost <- c(50, 75, 90, 100, 150)
# Here is an example of how to create a character vector
food <- c("pizza", "burgers", "salads", "cheese", "pasta")

length(v)

Create a vector of every 9th number from 81 to 9000 and get its length?

Create a vector of 50 equally spaced elements for the numbers between 975 and 1175?
v <- seq(975, 1175, length.out = 50)

#Interesting side note 1L is an integer
class(1L)

#Vector coercion
v <- (45,9,7,11,'w')
v<-as.character()
