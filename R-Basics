#What is the sum of the first 2000 positive integers?
n <- 2000
n*(n+1)/2

# log to the base 20 of 2000
log(base = 20, 2000)

#sqrt of the log to the base 20 of 16000:
log(base = 20, 16000)


#Load package and data

library(dslabs)
data(mtcars)

# Use the function names to extract the variable names 
names(mtcars)

# To access the miles/US gallon variable from the mtcars dataset use this code:
mpg <- mtcars$mpg 

# To determine the class of object `mpg` we use this code:
class(mpg)

# Use the accessor to extract horsepower and assign it to a
a <- mtcars$hp
# Determine the class of a
class(a)

# Extracting mpg data with the square brackets:
o <- mtcars[["mpg"]] 

# Confirm these two are the same
identical(o, mpg)

# Determine the number of miles/US gallon included in this variable 
length(levels(mpg)) #The function levels shows us the categories for the factor.

#Another way to obtain the frequencies, like above
table(mpg)
