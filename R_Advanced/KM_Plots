KM Plots
data is located at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BY3vOXDQWSlRtK2mKhAtRwIR-vzoDm-4/view


```{r}
library(survival) 
library(ggplot2) 
```

```{r}
gender <- as.factor(g[,"gender"])
fu_time <- g[,"fu_time"]
death <- g[,"death"]
```

```{r}
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ 1)

plot(km_fit)
```
Survfit” fits a simple survival model that depends only on gender in terms of predictors: in this case there aren’t any predictors, so the model just has the intercept, denoted by “1”. The two arguments used by “Surv” are the follow-up time for each patient and whether they died. In our data, death=1 for people who had died by the end of the follow-up period, and death=0 for those still alive at that time. Technically, those people still alive are censored, because we don’t know when they’ll die (of course everyone does at some point). 

```{r}
summary(km_fit, times = c(1:7,30,60,90*(1:10))) 
```

Split Curve by Gender
```{r}
km_gender_fit <- survfit(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ gender) 

plot(km_gender_fit)
```

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ gender, rho=0)
```

```{r}
age_65plus <- ifelse(g[,"age"]>=65,1,0)
```
```{r}
table(age_65plus, exclude = NULL)
```

```{r}
table(g$age,age_65plus, exclude = NULL)
```

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ age_65plus, rho=0)
```
