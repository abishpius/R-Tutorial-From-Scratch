What is the probability of not seeing a 20 when rolling a 20-sided die four times?
# Assign the variable 'p_no20' as the probability of not seeing a 20 on a single roll.
p_no20 <- 1-(1/20)
# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 20 on four rolls using `p_no20'.
p_no20^4

Suppose it is the NBA finals Raptors vs Warriors. The raptors have a 55% chance of winning each game.
What is the probability that the Warriors will win at least 1 game in the first 4?
# Assign the variable `p_rap_win` as the probability that the Raptors will win the first four games of the series.
p_rap_win <- .55^4

# Using the variable `p_rap_win`, calculate the probability that the Warriors win at least one game in the first four games of the series.
1 - p_rap_win

Now lets do a Monte Carlo Simulation 10000 times to see the Raptors chance at 4 game sweep.
rap_win = replicate(B, {simulated_games <- sample(c("win","lose"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.55, 0.45))
all(simulated_games == "win")})
mean(rap_win)

Suppose the Raptors lose the first 2 games, what is the probability they win the series (Note prob of win/loss is 50/50).
# Assign a variable 'n' as the number of remaining games
n<-5
# Create a vector of possible game outcomes, where 0 indicates a loss and 1 indicates a win for the Raptors.
outcomes <- c(0,1)
# Use the `rep` function on `list(outcomes)` to create list of length `n`.
l <- rep(list(outcomes),n)
# Create a data frame named that contains all combinations of possible outcomes for the remaining games.
possibilities <- expand.grid(l) 
# Create a vector that indicates whether each row in the data frame 'possibilities' contains enough wins for the Raptors to win the series.
results <- rowSums(possibilities) >= 4
# Calculate the probability that the Raptors win the series.
mean(results)

Now use Monte Carlo to Simulate the Raptors chance of winning after losing the first two games.
B <- 10000
results <- replicate(B,{sum(sample(c(0,1), 5, replace = TRUE)) >= 4})

mean(results)

Advanced: Suppose two teams A and B, where A is better than B.
# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series 'N' for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(N, p){
      B <- 10000
      result <- replicate(B, {
        b_win <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
        sum(b_win)>=(N+1)/2
        })
      mean(result)
    }
